And this for an obvious reason, that it is the only profession open\n\nto an educated woman of average ability. Few are aware of the extent to which women of the lower classes are employed in\n\nundomestic labour, in the factory, the workshop, and the field;-but while all our lady readers have received instruction from some\n\nclass of governess, there is probably not one who has not also some relative or cherished friend either actually engaged in teaching, or\n\nhaving formerly been so engaged. We find families who have no link with the army, the navy, or the church; others, who in all their\n\nwide-spread connection, have kept aloof from trade;-but from the highest to the lowest rank in which a liberal education is bestowed, we shall find some cousin or friend who is a governess. Indeed, it is not a question of rank at all, for the unmarried female members\n\nof the small merchant ' s family enter the profession from natural necessityand the fortuneless daughters of the highly connected\n\nclergyman, have often no other resource.

Every race has its specialite of function in the great sum total of humanity.\n\nWhile the Hindoo pecks rice, sleeps, bathes, fights, and embroiders coats of many colours, and the Mohammedan Arab sits cross-legged\n\nin the sun and plays endless games of backgammon, the Anglo-Saxon man digs and ploughsspins and weavesbuys and sells.\n\nHe is a sturdy sensible fellow,, has a square forehead, and an active body; he can calculate well, and usually knows how to buy in\n\nthe cheapest and sell in the dearest market. If he be neither literary nor artistic, and nationally he is surely neither the one\n\nnor the other, Mr. Bull has an unusually fair share of what is termed \" good common sense. \" Has Mrs. Bull no feminine counterpart\n\nto these fine sterling qualities? We think she has. Mrs. Bull is what is usually termed a \" motherly body\" and not only looks, after the children, but after the storeroom too. She weighs the cheese and bacon, and metes out the flannel. She looks after the\n\nfarmer's men, and flatters her husband's customers with a certain honest frankness which is delightful to behold. In fine, the\n\nEnglishwoman in country districts, where many duties lie ready to her handand where the mania for rising in life has not turned the, best parlour into a boudoir, and the fiddle into a cornet a piston, represents the feminine side of the same active and sterling\n\ncharacter which is supposed to mark the Englishman; witness a host of popular songstalesand caricatures. Naywhen Punch takes,,, our gracious Queen as the typical lady of the country, what an indescribable air of wholesome activity he communicates to the\n\npicture, reminding one of Solomon ' s good woman! Surely then the daughters of our flourishing tradesmen, our small merchants\n\nand manufacturers, who remain single for a few, or more than a few yearsmay find some occupation more healthymore exciting, and,, more profitable than the under ranks of governessing.

These were letters sad enough to make\n\nan angel mourn; anguished cries for help; letters filled with bitterest self-contempt and upbraiding; letters ill-spelt and\n\nillwritten, but couched occasionally in singularly eloquent words, in terms of strange refinement evidently caught in miserable\n\nintercourse with men of education. Often a markedly wayward, violent spirit breathed from the blurred and blotted words, mingling with\n\na cry after deliverance. It was as though the hand which inscribed them had now been guided by a demon, now by a guardian\n\nangel. The information respecting one letter lives in my mind as the\n\nlast act of a gloomy tragedy. The writer said that she had suddenly left _\" her friend\" the term always used by these poor friendless, beings as if in bitter mockery of themselves, \"wherefore she knew not, except that something within her compelled her to leave him,\n\nand break her bonds. She wrote that she had \" money in advance, and comfortable, nay, handsome apartments, but that she was\n\nimpelled to go; and besought, in the most urgent terms, for help. \" She went on to saythat, if the Warden would bub take compassion, upon her, at a certain time, and at a certain place which she mentioned in Drury Lane, he would meet with her."}

I found myself at six o ' clock in a desert of dining room with an oasis of table. I was the only guest. It was a dismal meal; the\n\nmouldy waiter attended upon me; and I had bad dreams in the catafalque all night long.\n\nWhile I was breakfasting the next morning I received a message from my friend the verger. Another traveller had turned up; the\n\npilgrims were still anxious for a sight of the relics; and the authorities consented for once to open the treasury-doors in favour of\n\nfour. Punctual as I was to the time appointed, the pilgrims were there\n\nbefore me-a pair of stalwart, broad-shouldered, barefooted Capuchinsodorous of garlic and cognac. One had a patch across his, eye; the other -was lame, and wore a bandage round his ankle. Both kept their hoods well over their faces, and neither was exactly\n\nthe sort of mendicant that one would prefer to meet towards dusk upon a lonely road among the mountains.\n\n- The fourth traveller had not yet arrived, so I returned to the stone seat of yesterdayand the Capuchins paced up and down, before the treasury door, conversing in -whispers. Thus H _^ _reten - - fifteen minutes went by, and the chimes jangled at the\n\n_quarter. The pilgrims, who had been glancing up at the clock every\n\nhalfdozen seconds or so all the time, now grew more and more impatient.\n\n\"Ce diable de voyageur I will he never come? \" was the overloud and somewhat irreverent exclamation of the monk with the patch.\n\nHis companion shrugged his shoulders, glanced hurriedly in my direction, and muttered some inaudible reply.\n\nI rose, and went towards them. \" I fear, \" said I, \" that we shall all be _disappointed this morning;\n\nfor the treasury cannot be seen after midday, and it now wants but twenty minutes to the hour. \"\n\nThe pilgrims groaned and wagged their heads simultaneously. \" We are poor servants of the church\" said the former speaker,, crossing himself with great humility. \"We are making a pilgrimage to all the objets saints of the department. It is a great delay\n\nto us, Monsieur, -a melancholy delay!\" \" And a spiritual privation, Brother Ambroise, \" added the other,"}

To the left lay the city; to the right high embankments, a drawbridge, a\n\nstretch of flat country, and a long perspective of canal-like river bordered by files of monotonous poplars. The first object that met\n\nmv _eyes w _& s the passage-boat moored up beside a tiny 'wooden landing-place. It was a heavy, square-built, green and yellow boat,\n\nwith a dirty little pavilion at the poop. The interior of this pavilion was furnished with benches, and lit by a row of little\n\nwindows all the way round. On a shelf of deck near the prow sat some three or four grimy men, cooking their dinner over a brazier;\n\nand between this shelf and the pavilion the boat was laden with wood, hay, charcoal, and market produce.

A breath of cool air, however, and one glimpse of a bulky, broad-shouldered man in a loose\n\npea-coat and woollen cap, was all that I could obtain. Scarcely had he looked out when he exchanged a hurried greeting with some\n\none down below. \" Come up, \" I heard him say. \" Gome up.

So let us be thankful for our\n\ntall white, aloe-blossom,, and be p leased at this painting on ivory of society in Salisbury Close.\n\nBut we here come to the one quality, if quality it can be called, which rather constitutes the essential mould of this poem;-it is, - -\n\nin no bad sensebut most unmitigatedly, -conventional. We mean that at no other place, than in this country, and in no other rank than in\n\nthat rankand at no other time of the -world ' s history did people, conduct their courtship and their \"wedding in that manner; and the\n\nstory is so told that the young college-bred squire, and the Dean ' s eldest daughterare onlpresent to our sympathies under those\n\nparticular outside, characteristics y, and could no more have made love, and got married, in those wretchedly awkward and narrow\n\ncircumstances which oblige people to go to Gravesend for their one day ' s wedding tripand then back to keep the ledger and make the\n\nbedsthan Sir Charles, Grandison could have wooed and won his Harriet, Byron if he had suddenly found himself transformed into\n\nAlonzo the Brave and the lady into Imogene the Fair. A maroon coat and silk tights were necessary to Grandison; until he got them,\n\nhe would have had no platform on which to display his many fine and noble attributes. In the same way, we cannot conceive what\n\nvision Mr. Coventry Patmore could in his most prolific moments embodyof a woman who could not afford to wear white kid gloves,, -or at least a muslin gown and blue sash. Many great poems have been quaint and conventional enough in\n\ntheir accessories. Chaucer and Dante paint good and fair women, great and gallant men, in all the moral costume of their respective"}

During this period\n\nshe obtained testimonials of study from Baron Dubois, Dr. Burrows, Dr. Hue, Mr. Paget, and other eminent Physicians and Surgeons\n\nunder whom she had continued her Medical education in Paris and in London.

Having already, by her previous efforts, brought the subject of\n\nFemale Physicians for Women and Children prominently before the public of the United States, she regarded that country as being\n\nprobably better prepared than her native land to support a ladydoctor.

I never had it in, my power, I lament to say, to testify in any substantial shape the gratitude I felt towards her, for having infused a love of books into\n\nmy mind. The above account of an amiable and accomplished woman (\"\n\nenduring servitude patiently and cheerfully ) is strictly true * I say that she was accomplished, because she knew thoroughly and entirely all\n\nthat she assumed to know. She had no little gaudy acquirements-patches and fragments of knowledge, - -scraps of\n\nlanguage-, dexterity on the piano-forte: -she did not know \" vulgar and decimal fractions, \" which appear now to be a necessity for every\n\none to know: she did not understand Poonah painting, nor painting on velvet. In the present day, she would never have\n\nsoughtnever have dared-to become a governess; but \"would have retired contentedly into another sphere-doing simply her duty, -doing\n\nwhatever she engaged to do completely, -and forcing respect from every one fortunate enough to secure her invaluable help.\n\nFor my part, I value a woman who consults, not her own vanity, but her strengthher true instincts. Let her attempt that only which\n\nshe sincerely feels, she can accomplish; and let no one despair, who is sincere. Let her not anticipate a fall in the social ranks,\n\nbecause she is sensible and prudent. Let her not dream that all which is valuable in life lives within the petty prescribed circle of\n\nher fancy. \" There is a world elsewhere. \" To that world let her go. She will at least be free from\n\nself-abasement. And let her not dread a little temporary neglect-temporary solitude. Has she not a friend within? Are there not friends even\n\nin the loneliest places, to lift the soul up to things immortal, - eternal? Look aboveand all around. There are the azure skies,"}

Consciously or unconsciously, the mind associates\n\ncertain physical types with certain mental and spiritual qualities, and the manifestations of these qualities themselves are notoriously\n\ntempered by individual idiosyncrasies of constitution and health. For ourselvesso much importance do we attach to temperament, and complexion, that we will venture to predicate of Cyril the nervous-bilious temperament, olive complexion, hazel eyes, and\n\nsoft silken hair; of Clarence, the sanguine temperament, and its concomitants, crisp brown hair, brown or grey eyes, clear and\n\nruddy complexion. The Confessio Fidel of Clarence occupies one-fourth of the volume,\n\nand forms the most remarkable portion of it. Divided into two parts, ' The Development of the Individual Mind, ' and ' The\n\nDevelopment of Society, ' it represents two great questions of the day. Fearless in its handling of facts, and the deductions to which\n\nthey lead, this Confessio Fidei embraces a philosophy of progress, and a rationalistic belief in the Deity, valuable and refreshing in\n\nthis age of doubt, discussion, and demolition. Thinkers, and all who have any pretension to the name, will do well to study\n\ncarefully these excellent chapters.

In the year-not so much of grace as of hope-1848, the German\n\nParliament, on whose meeting so many high but airy castles had been built, was, as our readers are aware, in brief space dispersed\n\nto the four winds of heaven. Mr. Julius Frobel, a distinguished member of that assembly, was blown over to America, a country\n\nwhich he had long greatly desired to study, on the ground of its being the most eminently practical one in the world, and therefore\n\nthe fittest to afford an antidote to the most besetting sin of his fatherland.\n\nLike so many of his countrymen of the present day, he had become weary of what he calls \" fruitless idealism \"-disgusted\n\nwith pen and ink, to the extent of not being able to prevail on himself even to keep a journal-and with a ravenous appetite for \" facts, \"\n\neven though they should be coarse and stupid facts, so that they were but independent of the system of critics and sophists.\n\nWe cannot, nevertheless, help thinking that his first step in the new country savoured a good deal more of the idealist than of the\n\nmatter-of-fact man he desired to become; for while his American friends were exerting themselves to obtain for him a position fitted\n\nto his talents, and in accordance with all his previous habits of life, he thought proper incontinently to convert himself into a\n\nsoapboiler, greatly to the disgust of the friends aforesaid. When a few days afterwards he met one of them-a distinguished New York\n\nadvocate-and took the opportunity of mentioning the matter, and hoping that his new occupations would not be likely to interfere\n\nwith their friendship, the answer was, \" No-but you must not forget that when you have become a soapboiler you will be confined to\n\nthe society of persons belonging to a similar sphere of life. \" \" ' Then, ' be said accused I, ' you of Americans ' have stronger social prejudices than we in"}

The \" absolute isolation of the individual\" is considered the indispensable preliminary of all improvement in human society.\n\nThe most conspicuous preacher of this new gospel is a certain Mr. Josiah Warren, stated by Mr. Frobel to be a man of independent\n\ncharacter and original intellect. Besides devoting himself for a considerable period to theoretical and practical studies on subjects\n\nrelating to commerce and education, he established in the city of Cincinnati a \" Time Shop\" so called because the value of the goods\n\nsold was calculated according to the time employed upon them; whether any other element of value was taken into consideration\n\ndoes not appear. In 1847, when he regarded his preparatory course of study as\n\ncomplete, he set about the establishment on the Ohio, forty miles above Cincinnati, of a settlement to carry out his system, to which\n\nhe gave the name of Utopia. What amount of success attended the experiment is not stated; but since then another of these\n\ncommunities, or rather aggregations, of '' Sovereign Individuals, \" has started into being on Long Island.\n\nThe most astounding result of the new principles is, however, seen in their application to education.

She says the improvement in the behaviour, and manners of her pupils is very greatfrom the softening influence that is brought\n\nto bear on poor wild creatures who, have never felt its power before. Even in such as these there is a natural perception of what is ladylike and befitting a\n\nlady. The teacher went one evening in an old dress, as her scholars were of the dirtiest description, and they pointed out to her a hole in it, which their sharp\n\neyes discovered; they also evidently felt hurt at her putting on her glove before shaking hands with them. Surely this will lead to their becoming more neat and cleanly in their own persons and dresswhen they perceive the value\n\nof this in the eyes of one whom they love and, respect. I would also add a word especially in behalf of the hoys of this class, who may be even more\n\nmaterially benefited than girls by the influence of ladies. This lady took a class of boys at a Sunday-sohool in a distant country town, who had been\n\ngiven up as hopelessly bad by several clergymen, and in a few months the Sunday-school became a daily evening assembly, the boys often exclaiming, \" Oh Teacher! I wish you would stay all day! ' * If stories were read and\n\npictures shown to boys who could not at first be expected to settle down into the routine of school work, it would be a preparation for much good, and a powerful\n\nassistance to regular schools. The hundreds who run about the streets un cared for and with nothing to cultivate good principles would amply reward any such teaching as is suggestedand we commend the plan to all who have the, hearts to engage in it; the time and the opportunities will not be wanting when women learn to see what powerful influences for good are placed in their\n\nhands for reclaiming and guarding from vice those who will in a few years be beyond our reach, and _£ > erhaps lost beyond recall."}
